# LaTeX Beamer Presentations - TH Koeln

LaTeX Beamer theme in design of TH Koeln (Cologne University of Applied Sciences) for presentations

## Description

A theme for LaTeX beamer presentations in the design of cologne university of applied sciences (TH Köln).
![Example for a title slide](figures/example_titlepage.png)
You can insert your own images on the title page.
Setting the title, author etc. will automatically adjust this on every page.

![Example for a slide with block elements](figures/example_blockpage.png)
All (or probably - most) elements try to use the university's color theme.

For presenting I recommend a tool like [Pympress](https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress).

## Installation
Simply clone the repository into a folder of your liking.
At the beginning of your TeX file include `\usepackage{/path/to/LaTeX-beamer-TH-Koeln/beamerthemethk}`
with either the relative or absolute path.
Depending on your engine, you might have to install additional packages manually e.g. pdftex.

## Usage
Work in Progress
For now, please follow the example TeX file.
